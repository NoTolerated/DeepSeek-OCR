# Model License â€” Template

Some projects rely on model weights with licenses separate from the source code. Replace the
placeholders below with the official model license terms and distribution instructions.

Model: <MODEL_NAME>
License: <MODEL_LICENSE_NAME>
Source: <OFFICIAL_DOWNLOAD_URL>

## Usage Rights (example)

- Research use: Allowed
- Commercial use: Allowed with attribution
- Redistribution of weights: Not permitted in this repository

## Obtaining Weights

Weights must be obtained from the official source and placed outside of the repository. For local
development, use object storage (e.g. MinIO/S3) and point the service to the bucket via
environment variables.

## Attribution

When using this model, follow the attribution guidance published by the model authors. Include
citations in product docs where appropriate.
